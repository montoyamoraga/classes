## Week 1: Introduction to randomness for numbers and text with Python

### Randomness

[Randomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness) is all around us. From weather, to a roll of the dice, to the noise that we hear. Randomness is the the lack of patterns or predictability in events.

Even if we can define a limited set of possible states of a system, such as a 6-sided die, we can't accurately predict what will be the output of a system with randomness on it.

In this class we will use computers to create mathematical models of randomness that will allow us to quickly begin to incorporate generative and unpredictable outcomes into your art practice.

Some examples of randomness and art:

* [Chance book, Edited by Margaret Iversen, ](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chance): book by Whitechapel Gallery and MIT Press.
* [Dada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada), art movement, very name was supposedly chosen at random from a dictionary.
* [The Ephemerides](https://twitter.com/the_ephemerides), a Twitter bot by [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/), that posts random raw images from outer planet probes, accompanied by computer-generated text.
* [The Infinite Campaign](https://lav.io/projects/the-infinite-campaign/), artwork by [Sam Lavigne](http://lav.io/), that automatically generates and posts an infinite series of video ad campaigns.
* [John Cage, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage), John Cage is a composer who after 1951 introduced chance procedures to all his music, and relied heavily on the [I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching).
* [Pap√° o 36 mil juicios de un mismo suceso (2008)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334552/)movie by [Leonardo Medel](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3223128/), with more than 36,000 versions, a new version is generated every time it is played, thanks to [DVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD) technology.
* [Wikipedia random article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random), Wikipedia allows you to jump to a random article.
* [Wu-Tang Name Generator](http://www.mess.be/inickgenwuname.php), Childish Gambino got his name from this app.

### Randomness and computers

Computers are cool, they can crunch numbers at a very fast speed, store and retrieve information from memories and sensors, and can communicate with other computers too.

Computers are not able to produce true random numbers, but pseudorandom numbers. Today we will write code that produces pseudorandom numbers and analyze its shortcoming and strengths, and also check a method that lets our computer communicate with the outside world and thus produce true random numbers, yay.

### Uniform  distribution

[Uniform distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous)) are those where all possible results are equally probable. Some real-world examples include:

* Die throwing: 6 outcomes (1,2,3,4,5,6), all equally probable.
* Coin throwing: 2 outcomes (heads, tails), all equally probable.

### Normal/Gaussian distribution

[Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) are those where there there is a mean and a

### Poisson distribution

[Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) is useful for modeling the number of times an event occurs in an interval of time or space, if these events occur with a known constant rate and independently of the time or distance since the last event.

### Markov chains

[Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) are useful for modelling possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.

### Other distributions

[Weibull distribution, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution) is used for modeling wind speed distributions.

### Python for math and randomness

Today we will a text editor to write code using the language Python 3, and will execute our scripts using the command-line interface.

Before continuing, make sure to follow the instructions at [Python 3 installation](/installation.md/#python-3), on the companion file [installation.md](/installation.md).

Optionally, follow the instructions for setting up a [virtual environment](/virtual-environment.md). It is not neccessary but highly encouraged.

In my computer, a Macbook running macOS, *python* is for Python 2 and *python3* is for Python 3, so I will be using the latter throughout this text. Use the corresponding one for your setup.

Let's start writing Python code.

We will encourage good manners and good practices in programming, such as using comments to explain and document the code we are writing.

In programming languages, we can write comments: lines of code that are skipped by the computer and are only intended for human reading. They are useful for documentation and for explaining what each block of code does. In Python, if you type a "#" at the beginning of the line, it becomes a comment. Comments are also useful to skip lines of code that are buggy or we are testing, and instead of deleting we can keep them for future reference.

Write the following script: [00-testing.py](./../code/week1/00-testing.py)

To run this code, execute it on the command-line with the *python* command:

```python
python3 00-testing.py
```

You should see the following on the command line:

Now we will use the random functions of Python. We don't need to install them, but we do need to import them. We will use it to output a random number.

[01-random-number.py](./../code/week1/01-random-number.py)

Let's now create several random numbers, and introduce the concept of seed.

[02-random-seed.py](./../code/week1/02-random-seed.py)

This example was easy to expand, since we went from one variable to three of them, but it is a bad practice to copy and paste code. Also there are data structures that allow us to store related data in an easy way. In programming we call them [arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure), and in Python we call them [lists](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/datastructures.html).

Let's write a Python code that creates one thousand random numbers at a time.

[03-thousand-random-numbers](./../code/week1/03-thousand-random-numbers.py)

The *random.random()* command follows an uniform distribution between 0 and 1, that is, normalized.

Now let's do an example with uniform and normal distributions in Python, and let's use the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) Python module for number handling and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting.

To install them, use pip.

```bash
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install matplotlib
```

[04-numpy-uniform-normal](./../code/week1/04-numpy-uniform-normal.py)

### Randomness on the internet: [random.org](https://www.random.org/)

Bad news is that computers can't generate true random numbers on their own. Computer algorithms are only able to create pseudorandom numbers, which appear to be random but are not.

If we want to generate true random numbers, we need to access data from outside of our computer, such as the one at [random.org](https://www.random.org/).

Let's use random.org to get true random integer numbers.

[05-random-org](./../code/week1/05-random-org.py)

In this example, we used an if statement, which allows our code to behave differently in every execution.

Let's now get a random book from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/).

[06-gutenberg](./../code/week1/06-gutenberg.py)

### Randomness and text: [Tracery for Python](https://github.com/aparrish/pytracery)

Let's expand this to include text, with the Python module [Tracery for Python](https://github.com/aparrish/pytracery) by [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/), a Python port of the original [Tracery](http://tracery.io/) by [Kate Compton](http://www.galaxykate.com/).
