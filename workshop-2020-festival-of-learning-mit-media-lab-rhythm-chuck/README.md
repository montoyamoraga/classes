## About

This workshop was written and taught by [Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga](https://montoyamoraga.io/) and [Manaswi Mishra](https://manaswimishra.com/), research assistants at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/)'s [Opera of the Future](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/opera-of-the-future/) research group.

This workshop happened at the MIT Media Lab Festival of Learning 2020, Friday January 31 2020.

## Software installation

Today we are using [ChucK](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/), a free libre open-source software for computer music.

Please download the ChucK installer (or executable from the ChucK website [chuck.cs.princeton.edu/](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/)

After installation, you will have an app called "miniAudicle" on your computer.

## ChucK basics

ChucK scripts have the extension ".ck"

We can write code with any text editor, today we will use miniAudicle.

Remember to start the virtual machine.

All ChucK commands end with a semicolon ";"

## Samples

The samples were recorded using a Roland TR-08 drum machine.

## Further learning

There is a free [ChucK class at Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-programming-for-musicians-and-digital-artists/info), a [ChucK book](https://www.manning.com/books/programming-for-musicians-and-digital-artists), and we highly recommend checking out [Ge Wang](https://www.gewang.com/)'s PhD [thesis](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~gewang/thesis.html).
