### Code of conduct

This class is part of School of Ma, and will be ruled by their code of conduct.

## Summary

Randomness is all around us and is what drives natural events such as the weather and dice-throwing. Randomness is behind noise, and noise is present in every sensor measurement, including our audiovisual perception of the world. Randomness is what makes vinyls sound different than digital audio and film look different than digital video. Randomness is the lack of pattern and or predictability in patterns.

Computers allows us to create mathematical models of randomness and incorporate to our art practice, rendering new exciting new generative and unpredictable artworks, like it has been done in genres such as [aleatoric music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleatoric_music) and [automatic drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealist_automatism#Automatic_drawing), and by artists like [Lillian Schwartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillian_Schwartz), [Max Hawkins](https://maxhawkins.me/) and [John Cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage), and featured by institutions such as the [Random Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Institute).

We will cover math for randomness and probabilities, programming with scripts, programming audio synthesis and manipulation, computer graphics, video manipulation, and web concepts.

Applicants from diverse backgrounds, with varied skillsets and interests are welcome.

Don't feel discouraged if you know nothing about any of these topics, if you can use a computer you will be able to follow and learn in every class.

If you are an expert in any of these topics, you will learn how to incorporate other disciplines to your practice.

## Methodology  

Each class includes explanations of theory and concepts, and practical examples with software.

Students are encouraged to ask questions and branch out from the proposed timeline for class.

All the notes and code written is included on this GitHub repository, so that students can focus on following along the coding examples and not worry about taking notes or missing out.

There are also several links for further reading and studying.

All the contents of this repository will be updated during the duration of this class.

## Materials for the class

The materials needed include:

* A computer running either Linux, MacOS, or Windows. (No tablets)
* Internet connection
* Headphones

We will use free libre open source software, including:

* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), for editing audio.
* [ChucK](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/), software for computer music.
* [Command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), environment for executing code.
* [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), for interactive audiovisual web apps.
* [Processing](https://processing.org/), for programming interactive audiovisual apps.
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/), for math.
* [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/), for audio and sound manipulation.
* [Text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor), for writing code. I recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
* [VidPy](https://antiboredom.github.io/vidpy/), for video manipulation.

## Installation

Refer to the [installation.md](/installation.md) file to install the required free libre open source software we will use in this class.

All the material of this class is free, libre, open-source, and available on the web on a GitHub repository.

It is highly encouraged to use GitHub to share the work you do and the notes you take for this class. If you are not sure what GitHub is, here are some links:

* [What is Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
* [What is GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)
* [What is FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)

I would love it if everyone would upload the code they write using GitHub to share it with all classmates but it is not mandatory, it is totally OK to not do it.

If you want to start using Git over GitHub, I suggest these resources:

* [installation notes](/installation.md), instructions for installing Git and GitHub.
* [GitHub for Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), free desktop app for GitHub.
* [Learn enough](https://www.learnenough.com/), free online books about command line, text editor, and git.
